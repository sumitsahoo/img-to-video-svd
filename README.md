## üì¶ Dependency Installation

You need `Python 3.12.7` or `3.13.0` installed in your system. If you are using `pyenv` then check the version using command: `pyenv version`

1. Install poetry
    ```bash
    # Using pip
    pip install poetry
    
    # Using brew (macOS), if you are using pyenv you should use `pip install poetry`
    brew install poetry
    ```
2. Set poetry to create virtual environment within project folder
    ```bash
    poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
    ```
3. Install dependency and create the virtual environment
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ``` 
4. Run the app with poetry
    ```python
    poetry run python main.py
    ```
    or launch the app via VS Code debug menu. VS Code launch config file is also provided for easy debugging ü§ì


To update dependencies use: `poetry update`<br>
If you want to update dependencies in `pyproject.toml`, then you need to install plugin `poetry-plugin-up`. Use command below:
```
poetry self add poetry-plugin-up
```
Once installed, use command `poetry up` to install updates and edit `pyproject.toml` automatically.<br>
To view virtual environment location, use: `poetry env info --path`<br>
To generate `requirements.txt` using poetry, you need to have export plugin installed.<br>

Install the plugin:
```bash
poetry self add poetry-plugin-export
```
Once the plugin is installed, use `export` command to generate `requirements.txt`
```bash
poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt --without-hashes
```



## üîë Environment Variable
There are 2 environment variable you can specify.
1. REPLICATE_API_TOKEN: This is your Replicate API key.
2. GRADIO_SERVER_PORT: This is Gradio server port. This is optional if not specified in `launch` method.

## üö¢ Docker

If you are planning on deploying the app to cloud, you need a Docker image. To build the same use the `Dockerfile` provided. The multi-stage build makes sure the resulting image is smaller in size and only includes the libraries that is needed. Also the use of non-root user makes it more secure.<br>

Build arm64 image (Make sure cloud deployment supports arm64 images):
```bash
docker build --no-cache -t img2vid_latest .
```
For amd64 image (most common and widely supported):
```bash
docker buildx build --no-cache --platform linux/amd64 -t img2vid_latest .
```

Once image is built, you can push the same to any cloud provider and use a serverless service to deploy the same easily.

To run Docker image locally use below command:
```bash
docker run -it \
-e GRADIO_SERVER_PORT=8080 \
-e REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_key_here \
-p 8080:8080 \
--name img2vid \
img2vid_latest
```
